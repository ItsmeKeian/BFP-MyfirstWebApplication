🔥 Business Establishment Mapping and Tagging System (BFP)

A browser-based web application developed for the Bureau of Fire Protection (BFP) – Dolores Fire Station, Eastern Samar.

This system digitizes the profiling, clearance issuance, and mapping of business establishments to replace manual, paper-based processes.

📌 Project Overview

The Bureau of Fire Protection (BFP) is responsible for ensuring that business establishments comply with fire safety regulations.

Prior to this system, the Dolores Fire Station processed clearances manually using Microsoft Word and paper records, which resulted in:

Slow processing time

Risk of document loss

Data redundancy

Difficulty retrieving establishment records

No centralized digital mapping system 

CHAP 1

This project was developed to automate and centralize those operations.
